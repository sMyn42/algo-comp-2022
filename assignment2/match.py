    TODO: Implement Gale-Shapley stable matching!
    :param scores: raw N x N matrix of compatibility scores. Use this to derive a preference rankings.
    :param gender_id: list of N gender identities (Male, Female, Non-binary) corresponding to each user
    :param gender_pref: list of N gender preferences (Men, Women, Bisexual) corresponding to each user
    :return: `matches`, a List of (Proposer, Acceptor) Tuples representing monogamous matches
    
    Some Guiding Questions/Hints:
        - This is not the standard Men proposing & Women receiving scheme Gale-Shapley is introduced as
        - Instead, to account for various gender identity/preference combinations, it would be better to choose a random half of users to act as "Men" (proposers) and the other half as "Women" (receivers)
            - From there, you can construct your two preferences lists (as seen in the canonical Gale-Shapley algorithm; one for each half of users
        - Before doing so, it is worth addressing incompatible gender identity/preference combinations (e.g. gay men should not be matched with straight men).
            - One easy way of doing this is setting the scores of such combinations to be 0
            - Think carefully of all the various (Proposer-Preference:Receiver-Gender) combinations and whether they make sense as a match
        - How will you keep track of the Proposers who get "freed" up from matches?
        - We know that Receivers never become unmatched in the algorithm.
            - What data structure can you use to take advantage of this fact when forming your matches?
        - This is by no means an exhaustive list, feel free to reach out to us for more help!
